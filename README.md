[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thekvs/microproxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thekvs/microproxy)
## About
```microproxy``` is a lightweight non-caching HTTP/HTTPS proxy server.

## Main features
* Single executable with no external dependencies.
* Single simple configuration file in JSON format.
* Basic and Digest access authentication methods.
* IP-based black and white access lists.
* Ability to log all requests.
* Ability to tweak X-Forwarded-For header.
* Ability to specify IP address for outgoing connections.
* Reasonable memory usage.

## Installing
This project is written in the [Go](http://golang.org/) programming language and to build it you need to install Go compiler and set some enviroment variables. [Here is instructions on how to do it](http://golang.org/doc/install). After you've done it, run the following command in your shell:
```
$ go get github.com/thekvs/microproxy
```
and this will build the binary in ```$GOPATH/bin```.

## Configuration file options
```microproxy``` uses JSON format for configuration file. Below is a list of supported configuration options.

* ```"listen": "ip:port"``` -- ip address and port where to listen for incoming proxy request. Default: ```"127.0.0.1:3128"```
* ```"access_log": "path"``` -- path to a file where to write requested through proxy urls.
* ```"activity_log": "path"``` -- path to a file where to write debug and auxiliary information.
* ```"allowed_connect_ports": [port1, port2, ...]``` -- list of allowed port to CONNECT to. Default: ```[443]```
* ```"auth_file": "path"``` -- path to a file with users' passwords. If you use "digest" auth. scheme this file has to be in the format used by Apache's [htdigest](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htdigest.html) utility, for "basic" scheme it has to be in the format used by Apache's [htpasswd](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html) utility with -p option, i.e. created as ```$ htpasswd -c -p auth.txt username```.
* ```"auth_type": "type"``` -- authentication scheme type. Avalible options are:
  * ```"basic"``` -- use Basic authentication scheme.
  * ```"digest"``` -- use Digest authentication scheme.
* ```"auth_realm": "realmstring"``` -- realm name which is to be reported to the client for the proxy authentication scheme.
* ```"forwarded_for_header": "action"``` -- specifies how to handle ```X-Forwarded-For``` HTTP protocol header. Avalible options are:
  * ```"on"``` -- set ```X-Forwarded-For``` header with client's IP address, this is a default choice.
  * ```"off"``` -- do nothing, i.e. leave headear as is.
  * ```"delete"``` -- delete ```X-Forwarded-For``` header, this turns on stealth mode.
  * ```"truncate"``` -- delete all old ```X-Forwarded-For``` headers and insert a new one with client's IP address.
* ```"via_header": "action"``` -- specifies how to handle ```Via``` HTTP protocol header. Avalible options are:
  * ```"on"``` -- set ```Via``` header, this is a default choice.
  * ```"off"``` -- do nothing with ```Via``` header.
  * ```"delete"``` -- delete ```Via``` header.
* ```"via_proxy_name": "name"``` -- this value will be used as the host name in the ```Via``` header, by default the server's
host name will be used.
* ```"allowed_networks": ["net1", ...]``` -- list of whitelisted networks in CIDR format. ["*"]表示允许所有来源
* ```"disallowed_networks": ["net1", ...]``` -- list of blacklisted networks in CIDR format.
* ```"bind_ip": "ip"``` -- specify which IP will be used for outgoing connections.
* ```"add_headers": {"header": "value", ...}``` -- adds specified headers to outgoing HTTP requests, this option will not
work for HTTPS connections.

## Usage
```
$ ./microproxy --config microproxy.json
```
To enable debug mode, add ```-v``` switch. To only test configuration file correctness add ```-t``` switch,
i.e. ```$ ./microproxy --config microproxy.json -t```

This program does not support daemonization, it's better to use other tools like FreeBSD's [daemon](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=daemon&sektion=8) or Linux's [daemonize](http://software.clapper.org/daemonize/).

For example, to run as a user ```proxy``` on FreeBSD you should do:
```
$ sudo daemon -u proxy -p /var/run/microproxy.pid ./microproxy --config microproxy.json
```

## Signal handling
On ```USR1``` signal microproxy reopens access and activity log files.
